#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering can be defined as the systematic and diciplined approach to the design,  development, testing ,  deployment and maintenance of a software system.
Software engineering is important  in the technology industry as for the following reasons 
1.It enhances effeciency and scalability.
2.It Drives didgital economy
3. Promotes Security and Compliance 
4. Supports technological Innovation

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are 
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The NATO Conference
    The term software engineering was formally introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in response to the "software crisis."
    During the 1960s, software projects were plagued with inefficiencies, cost overruns, and failures due to a lack of structured development methods.
    This conference emphasized the need for engineering principles in software development, marking the start of a more systematic approach to software creation.
The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s)
    Early software development relied heavily on ad-hoc and unstructured programming, making maintenance difficult.
    Structured programming introduced concepts like modularity, control structures (sequence, selection, iteration), and top-down design to improve readability and maintainability.
    Key contributors: Edsger Dijkstra, who promoted structured programming over the chaotic "spaghetti code" approach.
    Languages like Pascal, C, and Ada were developed to support structured programming.
The Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001)
    Traditional software development models, such as the Waterfall Model, struggled with changing requirements and long development cycles.
    In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced by a group of software developers, advocating for:
        Iterative development (small, incremental releases).
        Collaboration between teams and customers.
        Adaptability to change rather than rigid planning.
    Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP) became widely adopted, leading to faster and more flexible software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process for developing high-quality software systematically and consists of the following phases:
    Planning
        Defines project goals, scope, and feasibility.
        Estimates costs, resources, and timelines.
        Identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies.
    Requirements Analysis
        Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements.
        Engages stakeholders to ensure alignment with business needs.
        Produces Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents.
    Design
        Architects the software system, including database design, UI/UX, and system components.
        Defines technical specifications and development frameworks.
        Ensures scalability, security, and maintainability.
    Implementation (Coding/Development)
        Developers write code based on design documents.
        Uses programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
        Follows coding standards and best practices.
    Testing
        Validates software functionality, security, and performance.
        Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
        Identifies and fixes bugs before deployment.
    Deployment
        Releases the software to production or customer environments.
        Configures servers, databases, and networking components.
        May involve beta testing before full rollout.
    Maintenance & Support
        Monitors system performance and addresses any issues.
        Provides updates, patches, and enhancements.
        Ensures software remains functional and secure over time.

Comparea and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The approach in Waterfall methodology is  Sequential wheras in agile methodology it is  linear	Iterative and incremental
Waterfall methodology is rigid, with predefined phases wheras agile methodology is flexible and adapts to changes
The project scope in a waterfall methodology is clearly defined from the start. On the other hand the project scope in an agile methodology can evolve throughout development
In Waterfall methodology, Customer Involvement	Limited to initial requirements and final delivery. Whereas in Agile methodology there is	Continuous collaboration and feedback
Testing	Performed after development is complete	in a waterfall methodology. Contionous testing throughout development cycle in agile methodology.

Waterfall can be used for Well-Defined, Predictable Projects
Example Scenarios:
    Government or regulatory projects requiring strict documentation and approvals.
    Medical or aerospace software where extensive testing and compliance are needed.
    Construction or manufacturing software with clear requirements and minimal changes.
Agilecan be used for Dynamic, Evolving Projects
Example Scenarios:
    Startups and software product development where market needs change frequently.
    Mobile app or web development requiring continuous user feedback and iterations.
    AI and machine learning projects where models need frequent adjustments based on data.
